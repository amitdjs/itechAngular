For dependencies you need to make sure that there's node installed in the system, once its there open console and do a 
npm install -g grunt
npm install -g bower 
Once you have those two in place come to the project directory and do a 
npm install 
followed by 
bower install 

Please reach out to me if there's any confusion.  

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma. Test cases will fail as I never updated them ;p
